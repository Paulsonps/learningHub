# What is HTML
## Introduction

* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
* HTML describes the structure of a Web page
* HTML consists of a series of elements
* HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
* HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

  <head>
  <title> My first page </title>
  </head>

  <body>
     <h1>Main heading</h1>
  </body>

  </html>

```

- Doctype: Declaration in the document of which version of the HTML standard is following
  The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
  In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:
  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```

- html : Root element which wraps our whole document
- head : It contains document metadata(used by the browsers or search engines), related documents, links 
- body : It contains document data which is displayed in the browser

### head element
 It is primartily about metadata, the information that is used by the browser or search engine and not necessarily displayed to the user.

 - title : Title of the document. It is also used in  the search engine optimisation.
 element
    - Use longer tiles(avoid one or two words)
    - Search engines will display 50-60 characteres, so not to have more than that.
 - meta : Allows to specify the metadata of the document(information about the author etc). It is used by the browser, search engines or othe web services.
 - script: Specifies the script
 - style : Defines the style to apply to the body of the document

### body element
  It defines the body of the document. It includes all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, texts, list, links, tables, images etc. 
  
### id v/s class
#### ID
 - ID's are unique.
 - Each element can have only one ID
 - Each page can have only one element with that ID
#### Class
 - Classes are not unique
 - We can used multiple class on same element or same class on multiple elements

 ### Headings
 These are important for SEO. Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
  #### H1
  - Primary heading of the document
  - Used by search engines - should include one in a page
  #### H2-H6
  - H2 defines a less important heading than h1 and h6 is the least important heading.

### Lists
  #### Unordered list
  Bullet list. List them with some bullet to the left side.
  ```
  <ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
    <li>Tea</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ul>
  ```

  #### Ordered list
  Items are marked with numbers or alpha labels.
  ```
  <ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
  ```

## HTML5 Structural elements
Basically the structural elements are used to divide the web pages into logical parts that are descriptive of the type of content they contain. Like a document, a webpage contains headers, footers, articles etc.

These are used to describe the content to the search engine

### main
It is used to wrap the main content of the page. It tells the search engine that the most important information regarding the search relevant is in this element. You can only add one main element in a page.

### article
It comes inside the main element. It is way to group content together and signalling the search engine that the content inside is important. You can add more article element in a page.

### aside
Defines a block of content that is related to the main content around it, but not central to the flow of it. The information that is not crucial to be displayed in the webpage can be surrounded by this element. i.e.,  Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)

### section
We can use this element when we want to group contents in a logical way. It is similar to div element.  Used to either group different articles into different purposes or subjects, or to define the different sections of a single article.

### header
Used to contain the header of a site

### footer
Used to contain the footer of a site

### nav
Logical container for site navigation. It contains the navigation functionality for the page.

### HTML Layout Technique - CSS Flexbox Layout

Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

*	Block, for sections in a webpage
*	Inline, for text
*	Table, for two-dimensional table data
*	Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
