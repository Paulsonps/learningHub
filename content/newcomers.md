## Newcomers Curriculam

Hey noob,

We use freecodecamp ( a non profit learning platform for Devs).

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn

Web pages / websites are built with HTML, CSS and JS

Watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K64fWX5z4U&feature=youtu.be

So Let's begin with

- Responsive Web design certification

At the end of this course you have to submit an html page that is responsive also with this design

After completing these basics your leader will give you a simple task to assess your skill.

You can take a screenshot to share the progress and achievements with others ( to your manager or team lead) like the one below.
