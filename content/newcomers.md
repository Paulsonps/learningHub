Hey noob,

We use freecodecamp ( a non profit learning platform for Devs).

Web pages / websites are built with HTML, CSS and JS : watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K64fWX5z4U&feature=youtu.be

So Let's begin with

- Responsive Web design certification

After completing these basics your leader will give you a simple task to assess your skill.

You can take a screenshot to share the progress and achievements with others ( to your manager or team lead) like the one below.
