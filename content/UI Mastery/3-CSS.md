### What is CSS?

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

* Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
* Internal - by using a <style> element in the ```<head>``` section
* External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

### CSS Box Model

All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.\
<br>
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model\

Explanation of the different parts

*	Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
*	Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
*	Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
*	Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
