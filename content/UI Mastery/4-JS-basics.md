# JS

## Introduction
Alongside with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the essential technologies of web documents. It is the one that makes the app interactable.

 ### Datatypes
 In JavaScript there are 6 primitive datatypes.

 #### Undefined
 A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.

 #### Null
 The Null type has exactly one value: null. It refers to the absence of a value. 

 #### Boolean
 Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false.

 #### Number
 Number represents numeric values eg: 11

 #### String
 It is used to represent textual data. eg: 'Hey developer'

 #### Symbol
 A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property.

 ### Objects
 Objects are nothing but an informtaion or data. These are the foundation of JavaScript.  In JavaScript, an object can be thought of as a distinct entity that can have properties associated with it. These properties define the objectâ€™s characteristics and behavior.

### Events
Events are actions or occurence that happen in the system.For example, clicking a button or pressing a key are events. We can use JavaScript to execute code in response of these events. Every HTML contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript code.

#### onclick
It is a mouse event that occurs when a user clicks on a button (or any element). We can add a logic against this event type. 
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
function submit() {
alert('Button clicked');
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<button type="button" onclick="submit()">Click me</button>
</body>
</html>
```

In the above example, when a user clicks on the button `Click me`, then a function defined for the onclick event(submit()) is executed.

#### onsubmit
This event occurs when we submit a form.

#### Onmouseover
This event triggers when we hover the mouse pointer on any element.

#### onfocus
This event triggers when an element gets focus.
