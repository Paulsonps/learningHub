# What and Why Vue.js

## What is Vue.js ?

Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Vue.js is declarative

Just like ReactJS, vue helps us to create interactive UI with intuitive simplicity. At the core of Vue.js is a system that enables us to declaratively render data to the DOM using straightforward template syntax. We will discuss on that later.

## Vue.js is component based

The component system is another important concept in Vue, because it's an abstraction that allows us to build large-scale applications composed of small, self-contained, and often reusable components. Also these components can be designed with ease like never before!

## Why Vue.js ?

By building on the best ingredients of Angular and React and adding its own unique spice to the mix, Vue turned out tasty enough to induce constant appetite in JS developers. [This](https://www.monterail.com/blog/reasons-why-vuejs-is-popular) blog will show you How popular Vue has became since 2019 and why Vue.js will possibly become the most used framework. Since it's launch, Vue has been evolving to become better and better. In 2019, the user satisfactory hit a rating of 91%, which shows the potential of Vue.js to reach higher heights.

What you wanted more? Here you go then. Vue.js has the best structure and is the most easily learnable framework till date. What makes it more impressive? With a rich collection of libraries and set of tools facilitating development, the Vue world has everything a developer needs. The more notable tools that amplify coding experience are the excellent Vuex for state management and vue-routing for routing and mapping your single-page app states to respective URLs. Vue also has its own DevTools, which come in the form of a browser extension. DevTools simplify application debugging and checking the state and hierarchy of components. They allow you to live-edit your app, track custom events, and time-travel debug your app to see previous versions and the changes made.

## One more thing.. The CLI

Vue provides an official CLI for quickly scaffolding ambitious Single Page Applications. It provides batteries-included build setups for a modern front-end workflow. It takes only a few minutes to get up and running with hot-reload, lint-on-save, and production-ready builds.
